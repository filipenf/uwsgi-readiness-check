# Utilities for pod lifecycle management
# Graceful shutdown: Called by the kubernetes preStop hook:
#  1. Creates a "shutdown file" which fails readiness checks and tells k8s
#     to stop sending more traffic to the pod.
#  2. Monitors the uwsgi stats socket for in-flight connections, allowing
#     k8s to kill the pod once it is drained
#
# Readiness check:
#  The readiness check fails if:
#  1. Shutdown file exists
#  2. uwsgi-stats reports queue size greater than 30% of its max size
#  3. the uwsgi-stats socket is not present (meaning uwsgi is dead)
